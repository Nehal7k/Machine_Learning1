We employed Naive Bayes Classifiers in the development of three distinct models,  each applied to different datasets: one related to drug data, another involving cancer patient  information, and a third dealing with spam/hat classification. The achieved accuracy rates were  94%, 90%, and 98% for the respective datasets
